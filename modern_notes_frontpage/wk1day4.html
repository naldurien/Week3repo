        <p><strong>DAY 3 ASSIGNMENT REVIEW:</strong><br><br>

<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-check-string-palindrome-not/">Palindromes:</a><br><br>
- we're taking input from the user and figuring out if it's a palindrome<br><br>
- set a variable to equal your input, maybe call it "word"<br><br>
- run a <strong>for</strong> loop to reverse through the word<br><br>
for index in range(len(word)-1, -1, -1):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do something<br><br>
- create a variable for the reverse of the word outside of the function, say "reversed_word"<br><br>
- then make the results of the reverse loop add to the "reversed_word" variable<br><br>
for index in range(len(word)-1, -1, -1):<br>
	reversed word += word[index]<br><br>
- then compare original word and reversed word using an if statement<br><br>
for index in range(len(word)-1, -1, -1):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reversed word += word[index]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if word == reversed_word:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("PALINDROME")<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Not a palindrome")<br><br>
- want to make this reusable? create a function. this removes the user input bit, because now you're passing the word variable to it when you first call it. You can also simplify the if/else bit into a simple return statment returning True if it's a palindrome and false otherwise. Then *outside* the function you have more flexibility to do things with that result.<br><br>

- As much as you can, make your functions do only one job per function.<br><br><br>

<a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/factorial">Factorials:</a><br><br>
- again, start with taking the input from the user<br><br>
- then write a for loop again<br><br>
for index in range(1, number +1):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do something<br><br>
- create a variable outside the function to receive the result <br><br>
result = 1<br>
for index in range(1, number +1):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result *= index<br>
print(result)<br><br><br>


<u>Overall Tips:</u><br><br>
- don't try to attack the entire problem at once; <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zkcqn39/articles/z8ngr82">start with small chunks</a><br><br>
- game designers starting a game may start with a red blob for the protagonist, a brown one for the enemy, etc. The graphics can come in after the gameplay motion has been fleshed out.<br><br>

- once we hit databases and other, more complicated things, you will be overwhelmed if you try to tackle the entire thing at once.<br><br>
- achieving small tasks will give you the confidence to move forward<br><br><br>


<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp">DICTIONARIES:</a><br><br>

- Dictionaries always contain *key-value pairs*<br><br>
- Values can be ints/bools/floats in addition to strings. You *can* do that with keys as well, but it's confusing, so keys are usually strings to let them be more descriptive.<br><br>
- If you want to store an airport name and its code, but together in one variable - use a dictionary<br><br>
- Dictionary keys and values are usually both strings. They are wrapped together in curly braces like:<br><br>
{"LAX": "Los Angeles International Airport"}<br><br>

- Dictionaries are *everywhere* online. How would you represent a single tweet, for example, as a dictionary?<br><br>
 <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"Text:"</td>
    <td>"(contents of tweet)"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"Name:"</td>
    <td>"(person's first and last name)"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"Handle:"</td>
    <td>"@whomever"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"Date/Time:"</td>
    <td>"(actual date and time)"</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

<br><br>

- You can create an empty dictionary (dict = {}) and add to it later<br><br>
- You can access the contents of the dictionary with <a href="https://realpython.com/python-dicts/#accessing-dictionary-values">bracket notation</a>.<br><br>
car = {"make": "Ford", "model": "Mustang}<br><br>

print(car["model']) - will print "Mustang"<br><br>

If you try to print a key that doesn't exist, you'll get an error. You can add key-value pairs pretty easily:<br><br>
car["isElectric"] = False<br><br>

If you try to make a key but don't give it a value, you'll get an error.<br><br>

Look at any item on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, and you'll see a lot of potential key-value pairs that could comprise a dictionary together.
<br><br>
 <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"Title:"</td>
    <td>"Widget"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"Price:"</td>
    <td>"$19.99"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"Description:"</td>
    <td>"This is the greatest!"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"Brand:"</td>
    <td>"ACME"</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

<br><br>
<u>ACTIVITY 1 - CREATE A DICTIONARY:</u><br><br>
- take both inputs for first and last name<br><br>
- create dictionary using inputs<br><br>
- print using string concatenation to include the "my name is" and punctuation<br><br>
print("My name is " + user["first_name"] + " " + user["last_name"])<br><br>

- string interpolation version: <br><br>
(Must use single-quote version to do this, because you've used double-quotes outside of the overall phrase)<br><br>
print(f"My name is {user['last_name']}, {user['first_name']}")<br><br><br>

**********<br><br><br>

<a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/nested-dictionary">NESTED DICTIONARIES:</a><br><br>

- How do we store address book information for a person who has multiple addresses (e.g. college students)? You can store a list inside of a dictionary. You can also have arrays containing dictionaries inside of the overall dictionary! The combinations are infinite.<br><br>

- Be on the lookout for brackets inside your dictionary - these indicate the presence of an array.<br><br>

- Let's go back to that theoretical Amazon product. How might we include reviews in our dictionary? We could go with an array of dictionaries.<br><br>

product = {"title" = "Awesome Widget", "brand" = "ACME", "reviews" = reviews}<br>
reviews = [{"title" = "wonderful", "rating" = 5}, {"title" = "terrible", "rating": 1}]<br><br><br>

<u>ACTIVITIES 2 and 3 - NESTED/MULTI-NESTED DICTIONARIES:</u><br><br>

- dictionaries can be on multiple lines so you can easily see everything<br><br>
- address is itself a dictionary, and the geo key within it points to yet another dictionary.<br><br>
- all properties except the ID value are strings, wrapped in quotes, even if they are numbers (we don't want to do math with someone's zip code)<br><br>

- install JSONView browser extension (others are out there for other browsers, though Azam recommends Chrome for development)<br><br><br>


<a href="https://realpython.com/iterate-through-dictionary-python/">ITERATING THROUGH THE DICTIONARY:</a><br><br>
<strong>Option #1</strong> - Use a for loop and iterate by key.<br><br>

for key in dict:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(key)<br><br>

This will just print out the keys, not the values. How do you iterate by key and get the values? That's what we're more interested in.<br><br>

for key in dict:<br>
	print(bank_user[key])<br><br>

This will print the values.<br><br>

<strong>Option #2</strong> - Iterate by value instead.<br><br>

for value in bank.user.values():<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(values)<br><br>

- This will print just the values.<br><br>

<strong>Option #3</strong> - Run a loop with the key, value tuple<br><br>

for key, value in bank.user.items():<br>
	print(key)<br>
	print(value)<br><br><br>


<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-ways-to-remove-a-key-from-dictionary/">DELETING FROM A DICTIONARY:</a><br><br>

del dict[key]<br><br>

From the Amazon product dictionary above:<br>
del product["title"]<br><br><br>


<u>ASSIGNMENT FOR TODAY - TIPS FROM AZAM:</u><br><br>
- use while loop to keep program going until user enters q to quit <br><br>
- find a nicer way to display tasks than just printing the dictionary as a whole<br><br><br>
