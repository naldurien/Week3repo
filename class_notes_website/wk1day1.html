<p><u>Student Success:</u><br><br>
They are here to help you find "your next best step" after DigitalCrafts. They offer Career Prep, Career Talks, Mock Interview Training (*highly recommended*), Resume and Portfolio Reviews, Guest Speakers, Employer Network, and Job Postings.<br>
<br>
Three full days of Week 10 will be dedicated to career advice, resume and portfolio prep. <br>
<br>
Mock Interviews are done through partners - a senior-level developer or hiring manager with a partner company will run you through a standard technical interview for one of their junior positions, then give you feedback. Recommended going to this toward the end of the bootcamp.<br>
<br>
Having your resume and portfolio approved by the Student Success department is a graduation requirement.<br>
<br>
Guest Speakers give talks roughly once a month; all past talks are linked at this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GCMFi2aIYSeeCrtUK3f2cVSVEyTop6CANxWak84BRhA/">Google doc</a>.<br>
<br>
The DigitalCrafts Slack has several job posting channels; one for remote, one specific to Houston, one specific to Atlanta, etc.<br>
<br>
One-on-one coaching is available (reach out to Angela).<br>
<br>
DigitalCrafts also has a mentorship program - they will connect you to a DigitalCrafts grad or another developer who wants to give back their time.<br>
<br>
They also offer an internship program. Not everyone is interested in such a thing, but if you are, let Student Success know, and they can hook you up with a company offering internships.<br><br>
Student Success is here to help you even beyond the end of your program - feel free reach out during your job search and even later, while looking for your 2nd or 3rd job.<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
<u>How Do I Earn My Certificate?</u><br><br>
- prove understanding of key concepts by completion of 4 projects (front-end, full-stack, React, final portfolio project)<br><br>
- meet attendance requirements (only 7 absences allowed - being away or off-camera for more than 1 hour is considered an absence) - class is recorded, but it's hard to catch up if you miss being synchronously present for more than a few classes<br><br>
- Student Success has to <a href="https://learn.digitalcrafts.com/immersive/#full-stack-immersive">approve</a> your resume and portfolio<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<p>
<u>Classroom 101</u><br><br>
- form a study group, make use of office hours (there are at least some office hours most days)<br><br>
- you can change your name in Zoom and Slack to your preferred name<br><br>
- zoom 101 has been e-mailed out; it includes instructions on screen sharing<br><br>
- office hours are 5-7p EST mon-thurs, 9:30-10:30p EST Tues and Thurs<br><br>
- a weekly poll is sent out to see how you felt about your week<br><br>
- a feedback form is available in the Learning Portal to submit at any time<br><br>
- also, you can always shoot Jake a message on Slack<br><br>
- week 5 and week 10 will have one-on-one meetings with your instructor - "performance reviews" related to your 1st and second projects<br><br>
- 90% of students sign up for the mentorship program, so do it now if you're interested<br><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<u>Words of Wisdom From Previous DC Grads</u><br><br>
- <a href="https://zoom.us">Zoom</a> will crash on you. Don't freak out, just restart<br><br>
- you're paying a lot of money to have people answer the questions you're NOT asking
- prioritize your homework!<br><br>
- talk it out, try it out, repeat<br><br>
- don't believe anyone who says your project is perfect - it can always be improved - perfection is not achievable<br>
<br><br>
</p>
<p>
<u>Azam:</u><br><br>
- feel free to interrupt at any point with any questions<br><br>
- "we have a lot of time to learn all the stuff in this course. first we'll crawl, then walk, then run"<br><br>
- "You'll be learning from each other not just me."<br><br>
- He has worked with THD, linked in, dell, blinds.com, centerpoint energy, schlumberger, and more.<br><br>
- All communication is on <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T0569RDC6/G01JY0GRPFB">Slack</a>, nothing is really e-mailed. you can install it on your phone and put it on DND when you want.<br><br>
- code editor - use whatever you want. download atom, or juypeter, or vscode (vscode is the one Azam will use)<br><br>
- class is 80% technical, 20% soft skills - but the soft skills are what builds your career, gets you noticed, gets you jobs. <br><br>
- every Friday will be review, algorithm practice, and presentations by class members. Three people per week will be selected at random on the Monday or Tuesday before; your topic doesn't have to be programming/tech related. This is just to get you comfortable presenting info to people). Presentations are 10 minutes each; you can use slides but don't have to).
<br><br>
- Class starts at 10:00 EST, Azam opens zoom 5-10 minutes early. Sometimes if you're on at 10:05, you might be totally lost. So be here at 9:59 at the latest.<br><br>
- Daily class "schedule" - usually 10:00 review, 10:30 lecture, 12:30 lab<br><br><br>

<u>Curriculum Roadmap:</u><br><br>
Week 1 and 2 - python<br><br>
Week 3 - html/css/bootstrap<br><br>
Week 4 and onward - javascript<br><br>
Week 6 - frontend project - split into teams of your choice 4-5 people<br><br>
Week 7 - start backend development - this is generally where the trouble usually starts<br><br>
Week 8 - SQL<br><br>
Week 9 - backend project (backend only two weeks). backend project teams will be chosen randomly, so instructor can see how you interact with those who aren't your buddies. because that's what the job is like.<br><br>
Week 10 - career week<br><br>
Week 11 - intro to <a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a><br><br>
Week 12 - intro to redux<br><br>
Week 13 - "advanced week" mongodb (if time), JWT authentication<br><br>
Week 14 - react/redux solo project<br><br>
Week 15/16 - capstone project (either working with a team or with a client you've found)<br><br>

There will be two quizzes - the first around week 6, the second around week 10 - just 10-15 multiple choice questions. Each should take no more than 20 minutes; this is just to check for understanding.<br><br>
<br>
<u>Azam recommends:</u><br><br>
- Physical fitness - This works to clear your brain and recharge your battery. This is when you'll solve a problem you've been hammering against.<br><br>

- Reading books - plan out how many pages per day will let you get through a book in a month. The consistency is the key.<br><br>

- Get a StackOverflow account - nobody knows everything, knowing how to find what you don't know is the key<br><br>

- Start a hobby project - create a site about something you're passionate about. All his top students have had hobby projects.<br><br>

- Start a <a href="https://medium.com/">blog</a> - get your name and your words out there. This will raise your visibility for the job search as well.<br><br><br>


<u>Success in Class:</u><br><br>
- try on your own for 30-35 minutes of "complete struggle" before asking questions. be curious. this isn't open-heart surgery, no one will die if you make a mistake. if you're doing 20 reps of a physical exercise, it's those last 3 reps that are building your progress, not the first 17.<br><br>
- be curious!<br><br>
- collaborate/communicate. don't isolate yourself.<br><br>
- submit your assignments - you will have problems with your projects if you don't! This is not specifically required for graduation, but it will come back to bite you later if you're not validating your knowledge. Azam sample-grades the assignments - he will randomly pick a few assignments from people and go through them in class. Everyone is roughly at the same level of knowledge, so if one person made a mistake, 5-6 others probably made the same mistake.<br><br><br>

<u>Problem Solving Flow Chart</u><br><br>
1) work on a task for 15 minutes<br><br>
2) if not solved, ask <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>, ask another student, google, etc.  Give this step 20 minutes. This is the "deep learning" bit that really expands your knowledge.<br><br>
3) if not solved, ask a DiR<br><br>
4) if not solved or the DiRs are busy, ask instructor<br><br>
If at any point along the flow your problem is solved, move on to the next task.<br><br><br>

<a href="https://calendly.com/azam-dc">calendly.com/azam-dc</a> - Use this link is if you want to schedule an individual meeting with Azam; not really for technical stuff but more of a status update/check-in, like "hey I applied for a job and got this letter that I don't know what it means."<br><br>

Slack channel pinned posts - go to the pin just under the name of the channel. Azam just pinned the calendly link.<br><br>

Azam doesn't use slides at all, just does live coding, and you can download the code at the end (or watch the class video).<br><br>
DON'T FOLLOW ALONG with his code, trying to type what he is typing, unless he specifically asks. otherwise it is too hard to follow along, you're focused on typing and can't really absorb the info well.<br><br>
Lecture is usually not super long but has lots of activities built in - approx 2 hours max but with several activities (10-15 minutes), so you can practice what he's talking about.<br><br><br>

<u>COMMAND LINE</u><br><br>
<img src="images/cli.png" alt="Linux command-line screenshot"><br><br>
Launch your terminal.<br>
*EVERYTHING* you can do in your GUI you can do in the command line. Why use the terminal?<br>
You need to get comfortable with it, because you s*will* have to use it as developer. A lot!<br><br>

Windows vs Mac command line - If you're using Windows, check out the link on the class Day 1 Github.<br><br>

<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands">Commands:</a><br><br>

ls <br>
means "list files"<br><br>

ls -a<br>
list all files, even hidden ones<br><br>

cd<br>
means "change directory"<br><br>

~ (tilde) means root<br><br>

go to deskstop is cd ~/desktop<br><br>

touch - create files<br><br>

open - type open, then the name - "open filename.txt" - in mac, the file will open in the default application for that filetype<br><br>

open . filename will open it in the Finder so you can pick the program you want to open it in.<br><br>

mkdir - create folder<br><br>

You can write content inside of files with <strong>echo</strong> - this completely overwrites whatever is inside the file currently, and only works with text. (you must use quotes, and itwill add whatever is inside the quotes only)<br><br>

echo "Hello World" > lecture-1.txt<br><br>

cat lecture-t.txt<br>
Hello World<br><br>

There are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line">hundreds</a> of command-line commands, but we will learn them as we need them. (When learning a new human language, you don't learn every single word in the language before you start to use it!)<br><br>

Jump up one folder within file structure: cd ..<br><br>

copy a file into a different file (again, overwriting whatever is already there if there is one):<br>
cp filenametobecopied newfilename<br><br>

move file (cut/paste):<br>
mv filename<br>
mv lecture-2.txt  ../day2<br><br>

If you're not moving from within the same folder, remember - you have to provide enough of the path so it knows what you're trying to do.<br><br>

So if you're in the outer week1 folder, you'd move it like:<br>
mv day1/lecture-1.txt day 2<br><br>

For any directory your root/home folder, you can get there by tilde/name, so ~/desktop<br><br>

For a heavily nested structure, you don't want to cd over and over. And you may not know the whole path off the top of your head either, to type it in as cd folder 1/folder B/yetanotherfolder/blahblah.  <br>
You can enter the cd prefix, then drag/drop the folder from the GUI.<br><br>

(Tab-complete: If you start to write a long file name and hit tab, it will complete it for you.)<br><br>
<br>
<u>HOW TO CREATE <a href="https://www.shellscript.sh/">SHELL SCRIPT</a> FILES</u><br><br>

File must end in .sh<br>
This indicates it's a shell script.<br><br>

Commands will be executed in order, so don't try to cd into a folder you haven't created yet.<br><br>

To run a shell script, must be dot slash filename<br>
./myscript.sh<br><br>

By default, Mac doesn't allow you to run scripts. To provide it the permission, you must use chmod:<br>
+x means "yes, execute this file"<br>
+r is read-only<br>
+w is read and write<br>
+x is execute<br>
can combine +xrw<br>
so chmod +x myscript.sh<br>
then run it again<br>
./myscript.sh<br><br>

Check that it ran; did it create the things you planned to create in the script?<br><br>

You can use scripts to automate often-done functions. You can set up a script to do backups, to fetch news from different websites and create a custom HMTL page, etc., etc.<br><br>
